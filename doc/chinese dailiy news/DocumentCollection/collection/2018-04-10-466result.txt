With a strong belief "Quality is everything", Shin Chun Enterprise Co., Ltd. (SCE) started business from Oct. 2003 in Kaohsiung, Taiwan.  Through non-stop efforts to become one of the most reliable screw manufacturers, SCE has succeeded in getting certificates of ISO-9001, ISO-14001, TS-16949, ISO-17025 etc. With these certificates, SCE did have created a very healthy structure in their production system. They keep producing/supplying good quality products and get very high reputation.  SCE's products have been export to many countries mainly Japan, Europe, and USA.Now SCE's production capacity has been increased over 1000MT/month. The usage of products includes construction, electronic, and automobile, etc.Not satisfied with exiting stable business, SCE keeps developing new products with customers or by themselves.  "ColorGuard" coating is one of them.  This coating contains no Chrome (neither Cr+6 nor Cr+3) so which is very clean solution to the environment.  ColorGuard is not just clean but also very strong against rust.  For some special types, the coating can even be well remained on surface through 3 times drive-in/pull-out.  Furthermore, you can have it with different beautiful colors, which will be of big help on identifying if you have used right screws after driving.The world is changing.  But the desire to get products or service in good quality has no change.  However the price of quality is severely asked can NOT increase, even it is asked to reduce.  SCE understands this trend and is trying to change itself to meet this severe request.(工商時報)
