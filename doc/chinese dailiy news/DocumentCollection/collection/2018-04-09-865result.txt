中美雙方就貿易摩擦的「口水戰」沒完沒了，美國總統川普不久前又在Twitter發文，指汽車由中國進口美國，關稅是2.5%，但當由美國入口至中國，則要25%關稅。川普反問「這算是公平或自由貿易嗎」，形容是愚蠢的貿易，並已持續多年。川普推文如下:When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%. When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%. Does that sound like free or fair trade.  No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE -  going on for years!(旺報 )
